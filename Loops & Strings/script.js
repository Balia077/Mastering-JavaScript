//Loops

//Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times. 
// There are several types of loops in JavaScript, but the most common one is the for loop.

//1. For loop
//2. While loop
//3. Do while loop


//4. For in loop
//5. For of loop
//6. For each loop


//1. For loop:

//Syntax:

// for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // code to be executed
// }

//Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
//Output: 0 1 2 3 4

for(let i = 5; i > 0; i--){ //reverse order
    console.log(i);
}

//Output: 5 4 3 2 1


//2. While loop:

//Syntax:

// while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
// }

//Example:

// let i = 0;
